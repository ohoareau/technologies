AWS CLI is using configuration files located in your home directory (as one of its method) to authenticate your api requests when using the tool.
There are 2 important files:

* `~/.aws/credentials`: contains your personal credentials
* `~/.aws/config`: contains additional profiles (so-called roles to assume)

To set your profiles, follow these steps:

* ensure you have a personal IAM user and proper credentials that were provided to you (a so-called `Access Key Id` and `Secret Access Key`). These are your personal API credentials that you must not share with others. If not, please contact the Team Tech Lead.
* ensure you have the following content to your `~/.aws/config` file (or create it with that content):

<% sortedProjectEnvs.forEach(e => { %>
    [profile <%- project_prefix -%>-<%- e.name -%>]
    role_arn=arn:aws:iam::<%- e.awsAccount -%>:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
    source_profile=<%- project_prefix %>
<% }) %>

* ensure you have the following content (at least) in your `~/.aws/credentials` file (or create it with that content):


    [<%- project_prefix -%>]
    aws_access_key_id = <your-AKI-here>
    aws_secret_access_key = <your-SAK-here>


`Acceptance test`

<% sortedProjectEnvs.forEach(e => { -%>
    AWS_PROFILE=<%- project_prefix -%>-<%- e.name -%> aws s3 ls
<% }) -%>

... should display a non empty list of s3 buckets for DEV environment.
