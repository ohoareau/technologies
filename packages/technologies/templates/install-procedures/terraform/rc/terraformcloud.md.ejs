* if not yet provided to you, request an access to app.terraform.io to the Team Tech Lead
* browse to https://app.terraform.io
* log in with your account
* go to upper right corner, click on your avatar
* click User Settings link
* go to Tokens menu item in the left
* if not yet created, create a new personal Token and pick it up (so-called `the token`)

Then add the following content to your `~/.terraformrc` file (create it if not exist):

    credentials "app.terraform.io" {
      token = "the token"
    }

if needed, here is the [Official Terraform Credentials documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/cli-config.html#credentials-1)

`Acceptance test`

    $ cat ~/.terraformrc
    credentials "app.terraform.io" {
      token = "XXXXXXXXXX..."
    }
